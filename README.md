Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management.This project proposes a comprehensive approach to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease detection using advanced deep learning models and image processing techniques.Although dementia can have many distinct origins,Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is the most common type.As the illness worsÔøΩens,it becomes more difficult for a person to do any work without assistance.The ageing population and the time it takes for a diagnosis are predicted to contribute to this frequency to rise. The traditional methods of diagnosing Alzheimer‚Äôs are labor-intensive for both patients and physicians,including the retrieval of previous medical data,magnetic resonance imaging scans,and sometimes even neuro physical testing, which can be difficult for patients to undergo.Machine learnÔøΩing models have the potential to improve the diagnosis of AD.In this project,I developed an Alzheimer‚Äôs prediction model using the InceptionV3 deep learnÔøΩing architecture.We trained and evaluated our model on a dataset of brain MRI images from patients with AD and healthy controls.The model is trained and valÔøΩidated on a carefully curated dataset, demonstrating robustness and efficiency in detecting Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease stages:Non-Demented,Very Mild Demented,Mild Demented,and Moderate Demented.Custom callbacks are employed to optimize training,ensuring the model‚Äôs accuracy and efficiency<br></li><li>IDE: google colab<br></li></ul></p> |
