| <a href="https://github.com/anjaly411/Alzheimer-s_disease_detection_using_deep_learning">Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive neurological disorder, significantly impacts the lives of affected individuals and their families. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management.This project proposes a comprehensive approach to Alzheimer’s disease detection using advanced deep learning models and image processing techniques.Although dementia can have many distinct origins,Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type.As the illness wors�ens,it becomes more difficult for a person to do any work without assistance.The ageing population and the time it takes for a diagnosis are predicted to contribute to this frequency to rise. The traditional methods of diagnosing Alzheimer’s are labor-intensive for both patients and physicians,including the retrieval of previous medical data,magnetic resonance imaging scans,and sometimes even neuro physical testing, which can be difficult for patients to undergo.Machine learn�ing models have the potential to improve the diagnosis of AD.In this project,I developed an Alzheimer’s prediction model using the InceptionV3 deep learn�ing architecture.We trained and evaluated our model on a dataset of brain MRI images from patients with AD and healthy controls.The model is trained and val�idated on a carefully curated dataset, demonstrating robustness and efficiency in detecting Alzheimer’s Disease stages:Non-Demented,Very Mild Demented,Mild Demented,and Moderate Demented.Custom callbacks are employed to optimize training,ensuring the model’s accuracy and efficiency.<br><p><ul><li>Tools Used🛠️ : google colab</li></ul></p> |
